# advPHP
A command line interface for advmame with ncurses

This is a piece of my museum. It's dated in about 2010-2011.
There's no way I can test it, as it segfaults (and I don't know why).
It needs an old-enough PHP version (before 5.4?).
It also needs advmame which is now dead (?).

Anyway, enjoy my highschool code :)
